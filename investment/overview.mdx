### How It Works

The investment flow consists of five main phases:

<Steps>
  <Step title='Wallet Creation'>
    Customers create a wallet account to hold funds for investments. Wallets support multiple currencies and are required before making investments.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Fund Wallet'>
    Customers fund their wallet with the desired investment amount. Funds can be added through various payment methods.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Product Selection & Quote'>
    Customers browse available investment products, get quotes for specific unit purchases, and review investment terms including fees and expected returns.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Investment Application'>
    Customers submit investment applications specifying the product, number of units, and other required details. The system processes and creates the investment portfolio.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Portfolio Management & Returns'>
    Customers can track their portfolios, view total investments, monitor interest accrual, and manage multiple investments through a unified dashboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

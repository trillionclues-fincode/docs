## Phase 1: Maturity Withdrawal

### 1.1 Automatic Maturity Processing

When an investment reaches maturity, funds become available for withdrawal.

    participant WalletService

    System->>PortfolioService: Check Maturity Dates
    PortfolioService->>PortfolioService: Identify Matured Investments
    PortfolioService->>InterestService: Calculate Final Interest
    InterestService-->>PortfolioService: Final Interest Amount
    PortfolioService->>PortfolioService: Calculate Total Payable
    PortfolioService->>WalletService: Credit Wallet
    WalletService->>WalletService: Process Credit
    WalletService-->>PortfolioService: Credit Confirmed
    PortfolioService->>PortfolioService: Close Portfolio
    PortfolioService-->>System: Withdrawal Complete
```

### Maturity Withdrawal Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Maturity Detection">
    System automatically detects when investments reach their maturity date.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Calculate Final Amount'>
    System calculates:
    - **Principal Amount**: Original investment
    - **Accrued Interest**: Total interest earned
    - **Total Payable**: Principal + Interest
  </Step>

  <Step title='Credit Wallet'>
    System automatically credits the customer's wallet with the total payable amount.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Close Portfolio'>
    Portfolio is marked as closed and moved to investment history.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  For fixed-term investments, funds are automatically credited to the wallet upon maturity. No customer action is required.
</Info>

## Phase 2: Early Withdrawal

### 2.1 Request Early Withdrawal

Some investment products may allow early withdrawal before maturity, subject to terms and conditions.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Customer
    participant App
    participant API
    participant PortfolioService
    participant ProductService
    participant WalletService

    Customer->>App: Request Early Withdrawal
    App->>API: POST /withdraw/{portfolio-id}
    API->>ProductService: Check Product Terms
    ProductService-->>API: Withdrawal Allowed
    API->>PortfolioService: Process Withdrawal
    PortfolioService->>PortfolioService: Calculate Early Withdrawal Amount
    PortfolioService->>PortfolioService: Apply Penalties (if any)
    PortfolioService->>WalletService: Credit Wallet
    WalletService-->>PortfolioService: Credit Confirmed
    PortfolioService->>PortfolioService: Close Portfolio
    PortfolioService-->>API: Withdrawal Processed
    API-->>App: Withdrawal Confirmed
    App-->>Customer: Funds Available
```

<Warning>
  Early withdrawals may be subject to penalties or reduced interest rates depending on the product terms. Always review product terms before requesting early withdrawal.
</Warning>

### Early Withdrawal Considerations

- **Product Terms**: Check if early withdrawal is allowed
- **Penalties**: May incur penalties or forfeit interest
- **Processing Time**: May take longer than maturity withdrawals
- **Partial Withdrawal**: Some products may allow partial withdrawals

## Phase 3: Withdrawal to Wallet

### 3.1 Fund Transfer Process

Withdrawn funds are credited to the customer's investment wallet.

```mermaid

    PortfolioService->>WalletService: Credit Request
    WalletService->>WalletService: Validate Wallet
    WalletService->>WalletService: Process Credit
    WalletService->>WalletService: Update Balance
    WalletService-->>PortfolioService: Credit Confirmed
    PortfolioService->>Customer: Notification Sent
```

### Wallet Credit Details

- **Automatic Credit**: Funds are automatically credited to the investment wallet
- **Balance Update**: Wallet balance is updated immediately
- **Transaction Record**: Withdrawal transaction is recorded
- **Notification**: Customer receives confirmation notification

<Info>
  Withdrawn funds are credited to the same wallet used for the investment. Customers can then transfer funds from the wallet to their bank account if needed.
</Info>

## Phase 4: Portfolio Closure

### 4.1 Close Investment Portfolio

After withdrawal, the portfolio is closed and moved to investment history.

    D --> E[Archive Records]

```

### Portfolio Closure Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update Status">
    Portfolio status is updated to "CLOSED" or "WITHDRAWN".
  </Step>

  <Step title='Record Final Amount'>
    System records:
    - Final withdrawal amount
    - Total interest earned
    - Investment duration
    - Withdrawal date
  </Step>

  <Step title='Move to History'>
    Portfolio is moved to investment history for record-keeping.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Update Dashboard'>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Withdrawal Types

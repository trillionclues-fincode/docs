This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough of the investment account opening process, from product selection to your first investment.

<Note>
  The account opening process includes **Product Selection**, **Quote Generation**, **Investment Application**, **Wallet Creation**, and **Funding**.
</Note>

## Overview

Opening an investment account involves selecting a product, getting a quote, submitting your investment application. The system automatically creates a wallet for you, which you then fund to complete the investment. This guide walks you through each step.

## Step 1: Browse Investment Products

### Why Fund the Wallet?

Before making investments, you need to add funds to your wallet. The investment amount (including fees) will be deducted from your wallet balance when you submit an investment application.

### Funding Process

### Funding Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Wallet">
    Choose the wallet you want to fund. If you have multiple wallets, select the one in the currency you plan to invest in.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Specify Amount'>
    Enter the amount you want to add to the wallet. This should be sufficient to cover your planned investment plus any applicable fees.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Process Funding'>
    The system credits your wallet with the specified amount. The balance is updated immediately.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Verify Balance'>
    Confirm that your wallet balance has been updated correctly before proceeding to make an investment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Funding Request Example

```bash
PUT /api/v1/user/wallet/fund-wallet/{wallet-id}/{amount}

# Example:
PUT /api/v1/user/wallet/fund-wallet/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/100000
```

<Warning>
  Ensure your wallet has sufficient balance before submitting an investment application. Applications with insufficient funds will be rejected.
</Warning>

### Understanding Investment Products

Investment products define the terms and conditions for different types of investments:

- **Fixed Investments**: Corporate bonds with fixed terms and returns
- **Dynamic Investments**: Mutual funds with variable returns
- **Risk Profiles**: Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive options
- **APY (Annual Percentage Yield)**: The interest rate for the investment
- **Maturity Terms**: Investment periods with maturity dates

### Product Selection Considerations

When selecting an investment product, consider:

- **Risk Tolerance**: Choose products that match your risk profile
- **Investment Amount**: Ensure the product accepts your desired investment amount
- **Maturity Period**: Consider how long you want to invest
- **APY**: Compare interest rates across different products
- **Currency**: Ensure the product matches your wallet currency

<Info>
  Product availability and terms may vary. Always review product details and terms before making an investment decision.
</Info>

## Step 2: Get Investment Quote

### What is a Quote?

A quote provides a detailed breakdown of the costs and amounts for purchasing a specific number of units of an investment product. It includes:

- **Unit Price**: Price per unit of the investment
- **Number of Units**: Quantity you want to purchase
- **Fees**: Applicable fees for the investment
- **Total Amount**: Total cost including fees
- **Investing Amount**: Net amount to be invested

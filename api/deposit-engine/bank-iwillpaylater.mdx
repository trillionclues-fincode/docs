description: "Notify the system that a customer will pay later via bank transfer. Creates an awaiting payment entry for the given PCN and payable type."

This endpoint allows a user to **mark a payment as ‘I will pay later’**.  

It is typically used when a customer cannot pay immediately but wants the payment recorded in the **Awaiting Payments List** for follow-up.  

This API is used by dashboards, finance teams, or back-office operations to:

- Record a payment intent without actual funds transfer  
- Generate an awaiting payment entry tied to the PCN and payable type  
- Allow subsequent operations to track or confirm the payment

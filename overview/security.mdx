At FinCode, we prioritize the security of your data and transactions. This guide outlines our security architecture and provides best practices for securing your integration.

## Authentication & Authorization

FinCode uses a robust **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system powered by **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**. Most API requests are authenticated and authorized to ensure that users and systems can only access the resources they are permitted to.

For detailed authentication guides, refer to the [Authentication](/authentication) documentation.

## Server-to-Server Security

When integrating your backend systems with FinCode (Server-to-Server), securing your credentials and tokens is critical. Unlike client-side integrations, server-side integrations often have elevated privileges.

### Credential Management

Your authentication credentials (email/password or API token) are the keys to your tenant.

<Warning>
  **Never hardcode credentials** in your source code.
</Warning>

- **Environment Variables**: Store credentials in environment variables on your server.
- **Secrets Management**: Use a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault) to inject credentials at runtime.
- **Version Control**: Ensure credentials are never committed to git repositories. Use `.gitignore` to exclude configuration files.

### Token Handling

Since our JWTs are short-lived (typically 1 hour), your server must handle token lifecycle management efficiently:

1.  **In-Memory Caching**: Cache the `access_token` in memory. Do not persist it to disk or databases if possible.
2.  **Automatic Refresh**: Implement logic to check token expiration before making requests. If the token is expired (or about to expire), use the `refresh_token` to get a new one.
3.  **Secure Storage**: If you must persist tokens (e.g., `refresh_token`), encrypt them at rest using strong encryption standards (AES-256).

## Data Protection

### Encryption in Transit
All communication between your systems and FinCode is encrypted using **TLS 1.2+** (Transport Layer Security). We enforce HTTPS for all API endpoints to protect data against interception and tampering.

### Encryption at Rest
Sensitive data stored within the FinCode platform is encrypted at rest using industry-standard **AES-256** encryption. This includes PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and transaction details.

## Network Security

- **IP Whitelisting**: (If applicable to your plan) Configure IP whitelisting to restrict API access to your known server IP addresses.
- **DDoS Protection**: Our infrastructure is protected by enterprise-grade DDoS mitigation systems.

## Compliance & Privacy

FinCode adheres to strict financial regulations and data privacy standards.

- **GDPR/NDPR**: We are compliant with data protection regulations, ensuring your user's data is handled with care.
- **PCI DSS**: Payment processing components are PCI DSS compliant to ensure the security of card data.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

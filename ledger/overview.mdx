Welcome to the Ledger Engine documentation. This guide will help you understand how our double-entry accounting system works and how to integrate it into your application.

### What is the Ledger Engine?

The Ledger Engine is a **double-entry accounting system** that records every financial movement across the platform. It provides:

- **Account Management** - Create and manage wallet accounts with balance tracking
- **Double-Entry Posting** - Debit and credit transactions with automatic balance updates
- **Transaction History** - Complete audit trail of all account movements
- **Balance Queries** - Real-time account balance and transaction history retrieval

### Key Features

### How It Works

The ledger engine flow consists of three main operations:

<Steps>
  <Step title='Account Balance Query'>
    Query account balances to get real-time available balance, account balance, and account details.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Post to Account'>
    Execute double-entry transactions by debiting one account and crediting another account with automatic balance updates.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Transaction History'>
    Retrieve complete transaction history for accounts with pagination support and filtering by interaction ID or idempotency key.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  For detailed visual flow, see the [Process Flow](/ledger/process-flow) page.

### Core Concepts

#### Double-Entry Accounting

Every financial transaction is recorded using double-entry bookkeeping principles:

- **Debit Entry**: Records money going out of an account
- **Credit Entry**: Records money coming into an account
- **Balance**: Automatically calculated as the difference between debits and credits
- **Immutability**: Once recorded, ledger entries cannot be modified, ensuring data integrity

#### Account Structure

Accounts in the ledger engine have the following structure:

- **Account ID**: Unique identifier for the account
- **Account Number**: Human-readable account number
- **Account Balance**: Total balance including all transactions
- **Available Balance**: Balance available for transactions (excluding liens and holds)
- **Currency**: Account currency (NGN, USD, GBP, etc.)
- **Status**: Account status (ACTIVATED, DEACTIVATED, etc.)

#### Transaction Posting

When posting to accounts:

- **Primary Account**: The main account involved in the transaction
- **Counterparty Accounts**: One or more accounts that receive or send funds
- **Amount**: Transaction amount
- **Direction**: Whether to debit or credit the primary account
- **Narration**: Optional description of the transaction

</Card>

#### Ledger History

Ledger history provides a complete audit trail:

- **Transaction Details**: Amount, date, type, and reference
- **Balance Changes**: Previous balance and new balance after transaction
- **Correlation IDs**: Internal and external correlation IDs for tracking
- **Pagination**: Support for paginated retrieval of large transaction histories

### Testing & Sandbox

We provide a full-featured sandbox environment for testing:

- **Sandbox URL**: `https://{domain}.fincode.software`
- **Test credentials**: Provided upon registration
- **Mock transactions**: Simulate account operations
- **No real money**: All transactions are simulated

<Tip>
  Use the sandbox to test all flows, edge cases, and error handling before going live.

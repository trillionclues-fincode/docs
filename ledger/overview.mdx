At Fincode, we have built a **modular, auditable ledger engine** that serves as the financial backbone for fintech companies to rapidly design, launch, and scale regulated financial products.

Our ledger abstracts complexity around money movement, balances, interest, repayments, and reconciliations—allowing fintechs to focus on customer experience, distribution, and growth rather than core financial plumbing.

### What the Fincode Ledger Engine Does

The Fincode ledger engine is a **real-time, double-entry accounting system** purpose-built for modern fintech use cases. It ensures accuracy, consistency, and regulatory alignment across all financial products.

#### Core Capabilities

- **Real-time balance management**
- **Double-entry accounting** with immutable transaction records
- **Multi-currency and multi-wallet support**
- **Event-driven transaction posting**
- **Product-level and customer-level segregation of funds**
- **Full auditability and reconciliation readiness**

### How It Works

The ledger engine flow consists of three main operations:

<Steps>
  <Step title='Account Balance Query'>
    Query account balances to get real-time available balance, account balance, and account details.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Post to Account'>
    Execute double-entry transactions by debiting one account and crediting another account with automatic balance updates.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Transaction History'>
    Retrieve complete transaction history for accounts with pagination support and filtering by interaction ID or idempotency key.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  For detailed visual flow, see the [Process Flow](/ledger/process-flow) page.

### Why the Ledger Matters

Most fintech failures occur not at the UI layer, but at the ledger and reconciliation layer. Fincode’s approach ensures:

- **Regulatory confidence** for EMI, MFB, bank, and PSP partners
- **Scalability** from MVP to millions of transactions
- **Audit-readiness** for regulators, banks, and investors
- **Product velocity**, enabling faster launches and iterations

### How Fintechs Use Fincode Ledger

Fincode’s ledger engine is typically used by:

- **Fintech startups** launching wallets, lending, or savings products
- **Banks and EMIs** offering Banking-as-a-Service or Lending-as-a-Service
- **Embedded finance providers** building financial products into non-financial platforms
- **Regulated institutions** modernising legacy core systems

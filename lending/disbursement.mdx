Disbursement is the final stage of the loan origination process where funds are released to the customer. Our platform utilizes a wallet-based disbursement model to ensure speed and control.

## The Disbursement Process

Once a customer accepts a loan offer, the application is queued for disbursement.

### 1. Wallet Creation
Upon the admin triggering disbursement:
- The system automatically creates a **virtual wallet account** for the customer if one does not already exist.
- This wallet serves as the destination for the loan proceeds.

### 2. Fund Crediting
- The approved loan amount is credited to the customer's wallet.
- The loan status changes to `DISBURSED`.
- The repayment schedule is activated.

## Withdrawal Process

Customers cannot spend directly from the loan wallet; they must withdraw the funds to their personal bank account.

### Step 1: Add Bank Account
The customer must link a valid bank account to their profile.
1.  **Select Bank**: Choose from a list of supported banks.
2.  **Enter Account Number**: Input the 10-digit NUBAN.
3.  **Verification**: The system verifies the account name against the customer's profile name to prevent fraud.

### Step 2: Initiate Withdrawal
The customer initiates a transfer from their wallet to their verified bank account.

- **Source**: Disbursed Loan Wallet.
- **Destination**: Verified Bank Account.
- **Amount**: Any amount up to the available balance.

<Note>
  **Withdrawal Fee**: A processing fee (e.g., 10 Naira) is automatically deducted from the withdrawal amount or the remaining wallet balance.
</Note>

### Step 3: Processing
The transfer is processed via our payment partners (e.g., Remita).
- **Instant**: Most transfers are instant.
- **Status Tracking**: Customers can track the status of their transfer.

## Post-Disbursement

After disbursement, the focus shifts to repayment. The system will automatically track due dates and can initiate auto-debits if configured.

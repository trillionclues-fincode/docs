### How It Works

The lending flow consists of five main phases:

<Steps>
  <Step title='Loan Application'>
    Customers apply for loans by selecting a product, providing required information, and answering eligibility questions.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Application Processing'>
    System processes the application, performs eligibility checks, and may trigger automated credit assessment.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Underwriting & Approval'>
    Loan officers can manually review applications, approve or reject based on risk assessment, and set loan terms.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Disbursement & Withdrawal'>
    Approved loans are disbursed to a newly created customer wallet. Customers can then withdraw funds to their verified bank accounts.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Repayment & Collection'>
    Customers make repayments according to schedule, with automated tracking and collection management.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Core Concepts

#### Loan Application Lifecycle

Every loan application moves through defined states from submission to completion:

```
REQUESTED → APPROVED → OFFER_SENT → ACCEPTED → DISBURSED
```

Applications can also transition to `REJECTED` or `CANCELLED` at various stages.

<Card title='Learn More' href='/lending/loan-lifecycle'>
  See detailed state transitions and what triggers each status change.
</Card>

#### Loan Products

Loan products define the terms and conditions for different types of loans:

- **Interest Rates** - Fixed or variable rates
- **Tenure Options** - Available loan periods (e.g., 3, 6, 12, 24 months)
- **Eligibility Criteria** - Requirements customers must meet
- **Fee Structure** - Processing fees, late fees, etc.
- **Min/Max Amounts** - Loan amount limits

<Card title='Learn More' href='/lending/process-flow'>
  Understand how loan products are configured and selected.
</Card>

#### Credit Assessment

The platform uses multiple data sources for credit assessment:

- **Credit Bureau Integration** - Access to credit history and scores
- **Transaction Analysis** - Analysis of customer transaction patterns
- **Alternative Data** - Employment, income, and other verification data
- **Risk Models** - Custom risk scoring algorithms

#### Repayment Schedules

Repayment schedules are automatically generated based on:

- **Loan Amount** - Principal amount disbursed
- **Interest Rate** - Annual interest rate
- **Tenure** - Loan period in months
- **Repayment Frequency** - Monthly, weekly, or custom intervals

### Loan Application Process

#### 1. Customer Applies for Loan

Customers select a loan product and submit an application with:
- Requested loan amount
- Preferred tenure (if applicable)
- Eligibility question answers
- Additional documentation (if required)

#### 2. System Processing

The system automatically:
- Validates application data
- Checks eligibility criteria
- Performs initial credit assessment
- Routes to appropriate workflow

#### 3. Manual/Automatic Underwriting Review

Loan officers review applications and:
- Assess creditworthiness
- Verify customer information
- Make approval/rejection decisions
- Set final loan terms (amount, rate, tenure)

#### 4. Offer & Acceptance

Once approved:
- System sends loan offer to customer with terms
- Customer reviews and accepts the offer
- And then proceeds to also accept the loan terms
- Application status updates to ACCEPTED

#### 5. Loan Disbursement & Withdrawal

Once the offer is accepted:
- A **wallet account** is automatically created for the customer
- The loan amount is disbursed into this wallet
- Customers can view their total approved loans

To access the funds:
1. **Add Bank Account** - Customer verifies and adds their bank account
2. **Withdraw Funds** - Initiate transfer from wallet to bank account
3. **Transfer History** - Track status of all withdrawals

<Note>
  Withdrawals attract a small processing fee (e.g., 10 Naira) applied by the payment processor.
</Note>

#### 6. Repayment Management

Customers make repayments and the system:
- Tracks payment history
- Updates loan balance
- Manages overdue accounts
- Generates reports

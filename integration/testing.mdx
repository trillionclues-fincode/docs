Before deploying to production, it's critical to thoroughly test your integration in our sandbox environment. This ensures a smooth launch and helps identify potential issues early.

## Test Environment

Our sandbox environment mirrors production functionality but uses test credentials and does not process real money.

**Base URL**: `https://${domain}.fincode.software`

### Getting Test Credentials

1. Contact your account manager or email [hello@fincode.co.uk](mailto:hello@fincode.co.uk)
2. You'll receive:
   - Test API credentials (email/password)
   - Test customer/payment codes
   - Sandbox domain

### Test Payment Methods

#### Test Cards (Hosted Checkout)
Use these test card numbers with any future expiry date and any 3-digit CVV:

| Card Number | Expected Result |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `4111 1111 1111 1111` | Success |
| `4000 0000 0000 0002` | Declined |

#### Test Bank Accounts
For bank transfer testing:

| Country | Bank Code | Account Number | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| NGA | `214` | `1234567890` | Validation supported, success |
| NGA | `214` | `0000000000` | Validation fails |

## Testing Checklist

Work through these scenarios to ensure your integration is robust:

### Core Flows
- [ ] **Successful Transaction**: Create and complete a full transaction from quote to payment
- [ ] **Failed Payment**: Handle declined card or failed bank transfer
- [ ] **Compliance Rejection**: Test with flagged customer data (contact support for test cases)
- [ ] **Beneficiary Creation**: Create beneficiaries for all types (Bank, Cash, Mobile Money)
- [ ] **Account Validation**: Test both supported and unsupported validation scenarios

### Error Handling
- [ ] **Invalid Credentials**: Verify proper handling of 401 errors
- [ ] **Expired Token**: Test token refresh flow
- [ ] **Network Timeout**: Simulate slow/failed requests
- [ ] **Invalid Input**: Test validation errors (e.g., invalid country code)

### Webhooks
- [ ] **Webhook Receipt**: Confirm your server receives webhook events
- [ ] **Signature Validation**: Verify webhook authenticity
- [ ] **Idempotency**: Handle duplicate webhook deliveries

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized errors">
    **Cause**: Expired or invalid access token.
    
    **Solution**: Implement automatic token refresh using the refresh token before it expires.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Validation not supported error">
    **Cause**: The payout partner for the selected corridor doesn't support account validation.
    
    **Solution**: Allow users to proceed without validation and manually enter beneficiary details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Webhooks not received">
    **Cause**: Webhook URL not configured or firewall blocking requests.
    
    **Solution**: 
    - Verify webhook URL is publicly accessible
    - Check firewall rules allow FinCode IPs
    - Test with a tool like webhook.site first

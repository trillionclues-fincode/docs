Congratulations on completing your integration! Before launching to production, follow this checklist to ensure a smooth and secure deployment.

## Pre-Launch Checklist

### Security Review
- [ ] **Credentials Management**: Confirm API credentials are stored in environment variables
- [ ] **HTTPS Only**: Ensure all API calls use HTTPS
- [ ] **Token Security**: Implement secure token storage and automatic refresh
- [ ] **Webhook Validation**: Verify webhook signature validation is implemented
- [ ] **Error Logging**: Ensure sensitive data (tokens, passwords) is not logged

### Error Handling
- [ ] **Network Failures**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**: Handle API downtime gracefully
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Provide clear error messages to users
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for critical errors

### Webhook Setup
- [ ] **Endpoint Configured**: Production webhook URL is registered
- [ ] **Idempotency**: Handle duplicate webhook deliveries
- [ ] **Async Processing**: Process webhooks asynchronously to avoid timeouts
- [ ] **Retry Handling**: Implement retry logic for failed webhook processing

### Compliance
- [ ] **Data Privacy**: Ensure GDPR/NDPR compliance for user data
- [ ] **Terms & Conditions**: Display payment terms to users
- [ ] **Record Keeping**: Implement transaction audit logging

## Production Credentials

To obtain production API credentials:

1. **Complete Integration Testing**: Ensure all test scenarios pass
2. **Submit Go-Live Request**: Email [hello@fincode.co.uk](mailto:hello@fincode.co.uk) with:
   - Company name and registration details
   - Integration completion confirmation
   - Expected transaction volume
3. **Receive Production Access**: You'll receive:
   - Production API credentials
   - Production base URL: `https://${domain}.fincode.tech`
   - Production webhook configuration

## Monitoring & Logging

### Recommended Metrics
Track these key metrics to monitor your integration health:

- **Transaction Success Rate**: Percentage of successful transactions
- **API Response Times**: Monitor for degradation
- **Error Rates**: Track 4xx and 5xx errors
- **Webhook Delivery**: Monitor webhook receipt and processing times

### Logging Best Practices
- Log all API requests and responses (excluding sensitive data)
- Include correlation IDs for tracing
- Set up alerts for:
  - High error rates (>5%)
  - Slow response times (>3 seconds)
  - Failed webhook deliveries

## Support

### Production Support
For production issues, contact our support team:

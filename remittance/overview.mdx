Welcome to the remittance platform documentation. This guide will help you understand how our international money transfer system works and how to integrate it into your application.

### What is Remittance?

Our remittance platform enables **fast, secure, and compliant international money transfers**. Users can send money across borders to beneficiaries via:

- **Bank transfers** - Direct deposits to bank accounts
- **Mobile money** - Instant transfers to mobile wallets
- **Cash pickup** - Beneficiary collects cash at agent locations

### How It Works

The remittance flow consists of four main phases:

<Steps>
  <Step title='User Onboarding'>
    Users register, complete KYC verification, and set up their profile with
    required compliance documentation.
  </Step>

<Step title='Transaction Initiation'>
  Users get a quote with live FX rates, select or create beneficiaries, and
  review transaction details.
</Step>

<Step title='Payment & Processing'>
  Secure payment via card or open banking, followed by automated compliance
  screening and FX conversion.
</Step>

  <Step title='Settlement & Notification'>
    Funds are disbursed to beneficiaries, and both parties receive confirmation
    notifications.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Core Concepts

#### Transaction Lifecycle

Every transaction moves through defined states from creation to completion:

```
WAITING_TO_PAY → VERIFYING → PAID
```

Transactions can also transition to `CANCELLED`, `EXPIRED`, `FAILED_TO_DELIVER`, `PENDING_REFUND`, or `REFUNDED` based on various conditions.

</Card>

#### Exchange Rates

Exchange rates are fetched in real-time and can be locked for up to **15 minutes** during the transaction process. The final rate includes:

- **Base exchange rate** - Market rate from our liquidity providers
- **FX margin** - Small markup for sustainability
- **Transfer fee** - Fixed or percentage-based fee per transaction

#### Beneficiaries

Beneficiaries are the recipients of remittance transfers. Users can:

- Save beneficiaries for future transactions
- Manage multiple beneficiaries
- Update beneficiary details
- Each beneficiary undergoes details validation

#### AML/CFT Screening

Every transaction is screened against:

- **Sanctions lists** - OFAC, EU, UN consolidated lists
- **PEP databases** - Politically exposed persons screening
- **Transaction patterns** - Unusual activity detection
- **Risk scoring** - Dynamic risk assessment

Bank transfers allow customers to pay offline and notify the system when payment is made. Admin approval is required to complete the transaction.

### Key Features

* **Offline Payment**: Customer transfers money via their bank.
* **Admin Verification**: Payment requires confirmation by system admin.
* **Notifications**: Alerts sent to admin and customer when payment is made.
* **Flexible Timing**: Customer can pay later using `bank_pay_later` option.

### API Endpoints

* **Notify Bank Transfer Payment**

```http
POST /notify-bank-transfer-payment
```

* **Mark I Will Pay Later**

```http
PUT /bank-iwillpaylater-wallet/{pcn}/{payableType}

### Best Practices

* Use `AWAITING_APPROVAL` to track payments waiting for verification.
* Admin should verify bank transfer before marking as `PAID`.
* Ensure notifications are triggered for both customer and admin.
* Handle `CANCELLED` state if payment is not received.

### How It Works

The payment flow consists of four main phases:

<Steps>
  <Step title='Payment Method Selection'>
    Customer selects their preferred payment method from available options based on currency and amount.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Payment Initiation'>
    System creates a payable item and processes payment through the selected method (wallet, card, bank transfer).
  </Step>

  <Step title='Payment Processing'>
    Payment is processed via the appropriate gateway or internal system with real-time status updates.
  </Step>

  <Step title='Payment Confirmation'>
    System confirms payment receipt and updates transaction status, completing the payment lifecycle.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  For detailed visual flow, see the [Process Flow](/deposit-engine/process-flows) and [Payment Lifecycle](/deposit-engine/payment-lifecycle) pages.

### Core Concepts

#### Payment Lifecycle

Every payment moves through defined states from initiation to completion:

```
PENDING_PAYMENT → CONFIRMED → PAID → COMPLETED
```

Payments can also transition to `CANCELLED`, `FAILED`, or `REFUNDED` at various stages.

<Card title='Learn More' href='/deposit-engine/payment-lifecycle'>
  See detailed state transitions and what triggers each status change.
</Card>

#### Payable Items

Payable items represent different types of transactions that can be paid for:

- **TRANSACTION** - Remittance/money transfer
- **WALLET** - Wallet funding or generic wallet payment
- **BILL** - Bill payment
- **MERCHANT** - Product/merchant payment
- **VOUCHER** - Voucher purchase
- **WITHDRAWAL** - Wallet withdrawal

<Card title='Learn More' href='/deposit-engine/process-flow'>
  Understand how different payable types are processed.
</Card>

#### Payment Methods

The platform supports multiple payment methods:

- **E_WALLET** - Pay from customer wallet balance
- **ONLINE_CARD_PAYMENT** - Credit/debit card payments via payment gateway
- **BANK_TRANSFER** - Offline bank transfer with confirmation
- **ONLINE_BANK_TRANSFER** - Direct online bank transfer
- **PAYPAL** - PayPal payments
- **MOBILE_MONEY** - Mobile money payments
- **CRYPTO_CURRENCY_PAYMENT** - Cryptocurrency payments
- **CASH** - Cash payments at branches

</Card>

#### Awaiting Payments

The "awaiting payments" system allows customers to notify the platform that they will pay via bank transfer:

- Customer initiates transaction
- Selects "I will pay later" option
- Makes bank transfer offline
- Notifies system of payment completion
- Admin verifies and confirms payment

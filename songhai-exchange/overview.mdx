Songhai Exchange(SHE) is Fincode's payment switching platform that facilitates cross-border transactions, enabling services such as bank transfers, mobile money payments, and wallet management across multiple currencies and countries.

## Base URL
All API requests for the staging environment should be sent to:
```bash
https://api.stag.songhaiexchange.io
```

## Authentication
The API uses **OAuth2** for security.
1.  **Generate Token**: Call the `POST /oauth/token` endpoint using Basic Authentication (Client ID and Secret) along with your username and password.
2.  **Make Requests**: Use the returned `access_token` as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header for all protected endpoints.

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
```

## Transaction Reference (PCN)
Every transaction is identified by a unique **Reference Code** (often referred to as PCN). This code is generated by you (the partner) and must be unique for every request. It is used to:
-   Track the status of a transaction.
-   Reconcile payments.
